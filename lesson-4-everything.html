                    This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I'll be sure to use the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags I've been learning how to code.

                    This is <span class="danger-text">another paragraph</span>, and I would like to quote the late, great Martin Luther King, Jr. who once said <q>I have a dream</q>
                </p>

                            But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity; one hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.
